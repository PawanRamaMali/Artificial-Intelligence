Artificial Intelligence Explained


What is Artificial Intelligence ?

It is a branch of Computer Science that pursues creating the computers or machines as intelligent as human beings.
It is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs.
It is related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable.

Definition: Artificial Intelligence is the study of how to make computers do things, which, at the moment, people do better.
According to the father of Artificial Intelligence, John McCarthy, it is “The science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs”.
Artificial Intelligence is a way of making a computer, a computer-controlled robot, or a software think intelligently, in the similar manner the intelligent humans think.
AI is accomplished by studying how human brain thinks and how humans learn, decide, and work while trying to solve a problem, and then using the outcomes of this study as a basis of developing intelligent software and systems.
It has gained prominence recently due, in part, to big data, or the increase in speed, size and variety of data businesses are now collecting. AI can perform tasks such as identifying patterns in the data more efficiently than humans, enabling businesses to gain more insight out of their data.
From a business perspective AI is a set of very powerful tools, and methodologies for using those tools to solve business problems.
From a programming perspective, AI includes the study of symbolic programming, problem solving, and search.
